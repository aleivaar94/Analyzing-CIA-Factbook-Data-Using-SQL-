# Analyzing World Factbook Data

The World Factbook published by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) provides basic country data such as metrics of the economy, energy, transportation, military, population etc. It contains data from 266 world countries.

Part of its data is readily available in a [downloadable database](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql) that can be queried and analyzed using SQL.

In this project I explore the database and answer summary statistic questions using questions. For example, which are the most populated countries?

Do you think Germany is over populated? See the code below to find out.
